# Angular / REST API Demo

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.11.1.

## Build & development
1. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
2. Run `bower install` to install client dependencies.
3. Run `grunt serve` to start our express API and kick off the connect web server.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma. (there are no tests). The grunt serve task will fire up nodemon in debug mode, and you can use a debugger to pause the app while interacting with the API.  You can also use a REST testing application, such as Postman.

## Structure

The `Customer` model is derived from a [mongoose][http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html] Schema. Backend routes are defined in `routes/`. Angular UI Router routes are defined in `app/scripts/app.js`.

## Validation

The requirements called for validating user inputs. These should trigger from `_form.html`. **Now working!**

## WIP - use at your own peril.

I may end up using $http instead of $resource in the `customersService.js` as $http provides a clearer path to intercepting API errors. I may just need to keep experimenting with the [$resource interceptor][https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource] and try a few more things. 

## Tips

To force rebuild your styles while `grunt serve` is churning, you can open a separate terminal window and run `grunt sass && grunt build` to recreate the styles. The load order can be affected in `index.html`.
